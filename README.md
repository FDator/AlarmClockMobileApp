1. **Project Proposal Report**
   - The length of the proposal must be 1-2 pages.
   - You have to mention the names of the group members. 
   - Explain the major features of your app
2. **Mid-Progress Report** 
   - In mid-progress design, you will submit the rough design of your application.
   - The current design of your app is according to those features.
   - Group work plan ( who will do which part)
3. **Mid Progress Presentation**
   - All group members MUST be present during the mid-progress presentation to the class (unless there is an emergency such as a health or family emergency). 
   - Prepare slides for a 10-minute presentation (max).  Each member will present for around 2 minutes. 
   - In this presentation, you will show the current status of the project.  
     - You can show the design(mockup if you have or direct android screenshots) of your project.
     - You can show the navigation of your project for features. 
     - You can show the code you have done so far.

   - In summary, each group will have 12 minutes (max) for presentation and feedback. 
4. **Final Video Presentation (Final week in class)**
   - Prepare slides for a 9 minutes presentation and project/app demo for a 3-minute presentation.  Each member will present for 2 minutes or more. 
   - The presentation contents will be similar to your written report and submitted code. 
   - Don’t forget to mention the challenging part in the presentation and demo your project for 3 minutes out of 12 minutes. 
   - Don’t forget to mention the innovation and merit of your project.
5. **Final written report (Font size: 12,  single line spacing, number of pages: 6, One column format )**
   - Summary/Abstract
   - Introduction
   - App description (describe different Features): 
   - Discussion (challenges, innovation, merit)
   - Limitations ( mention any error in the application, unfinished task, any change after the proposal)
   - Conclusion
   - References.
   - Appendix ( All app screenshots)
6. **Peer Evaluation (Individual):** Every student MUST complete a peer evaluation survey to get his/her score. The survey link and the submission deadline will be available on the ABET system. It will take only a few minutes to complete this peer evaluation survey. _You will be penalized 5 points if we don't receive your peer evaluation before the deadline. The following indicators will be used in peer evaluation_. 
   - _Listen to other teammates_: Consistently listens and responds to others appropriately
   - _Cooperate in harmony_: Never argues with teammates negatively
   - _Make fair decisions_: Always helps the team to reach a fair decision
   - _Research and gather information_: Collects a great deal of information--all are relevant to the topic
   - _Share information_: Relays all relevant information to teammates
   - _Offer help_: Offers help proactively and all the times when asked
   - _Full Assigned work_: Performs all assigned works
   - _Time management_:  Hands all assignments on time
   - _Contribute to a team meeting_: Gives all-important progress updates and contribute greatly to ideation

Your submission will be graded by simply running it and evaluating its functionality. It does not need to be perfect or bug-free to receive **partial** credit.
